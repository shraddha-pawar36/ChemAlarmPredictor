# ChemAlarmPredictor
ChemAlarmPredictor is a web application that uses machine learning to predict whether an alarm in the chemical industry is harmful or not. With this tool, users can input the details of an alarm and get an immediate prediction of whether it poses a threat to worker safety or the environment.

This project is built using Python, with a machine learning model created using scikit-learn and a web application created using Flask. The machine learning model was trained on a dataset of historical alarms, with various features such as the type of alarm, the chemicals involved, and the location of the alarm. The Flask application provides a simple interface for users to input alarm details and receive a prediction.

The purpose of this project is to improve safety in the chemical industry by providing workers with a tool that can quickly assess the potential danger of an alarm. With ChemAlarmPredictor, workers can make more informed decisions about how to respond to an alarm, which can help prevent accidents and reduce the risk of harm to people and the environment.

Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own work or contribute to it by suggesting improvements, adding new features, or providing feedback on the existing implementation.
